Once we train our algorithm using 2/3 of the train data, we start to test our algorithms using the remaining data. If the model performs well, we dump our test data in the algorithms to predict and submit the competition.

    "### Regularization Models\n",
    "What makes regression model more effective is its ability of *regularizing*. The term \"regularizing\" stands for models ability **to structurally prevent overfitting by imposing a penalty on the coefficients.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of regularizations. \n",
    "* **Ridge**\n",
    "* **Lasso**\n",
    "* **Elastic Net**\n",
    "\n",
    "These regularization methods work by penalizing **the magnitude of the coefficients of features** and at the same time **minimizing the error between the predicted value and actual observed values**.  This minimization becomes a balance between the error (the difference between the predicted value and observed value) and the size of the coefficients. The only difference between Ridge and Lasso is **the way they penalize the coefficients.** Elastic Net is the combination of these two. **Elastic Net** adds both the sum of the squares errors and the absolute value of the squared error. To get more in-depth of it, let us review the least squared loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary least squared** loss function minimizes the residual sum of the square(RSS) to fit the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ \\text{minimize:}\\; RSS = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p\\beta_j x_j\\right)\\right)^2 $$\n",

    "* One of the benefits of regularization is that it deals with **multicollinearity**(high correlation between predictor variables) well, especially Ridge method. Lasso deals with **multicollinearity** more brutally by penalizing related coefficients and force them to become zero, hence removing them.
